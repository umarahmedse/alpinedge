            confirmation of whether we process your personal data. If so, we'll
            provide further details and furnish you with a copy of the processed

          <li>
            <strong>Right to Rectification of Personal Data:</strong> If your
            personal data is inaccurate, you can notify us, and we'll promptly
            rectify it. Users registered on the website can also rectify and

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Right to Erasure of Personal Data ("Right to Be Forgotten"):
            </strong>{" "}
            You have the right to request the erasure of your personal data
            without undue delay under the following circumstances:
            <ul>
              <li>
                If the data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which

              </li>
              <li>
                If you withdraw your consent (applicable when data processing
                relies on consent) and there are no other legal grounds for
                processing;
              </li>
              <li>
                If you object to processing, and there are no overriding
                legitimate reasons, or if you object to processing for direct
                marketing;

              However, we may not fulfill the erasure request if data processing
              is necessary for exercising freedom of expression and information,
              legal obligations, tasks carried out in the public interest,
              establishment/exercise/defense of legal claims, or other reasons
              stipulated by law.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Restriction of Processing:</strong> You can request
            restriction of processing of your personal data for a specific
            period under the conditions outlined in Article 18 of the GDPR.
          </li>
          <li>

              Right to Data Portability and Provision in Machine-Readable
              Format:
            </strong>{" "}
            If your data is processed automatically based on consent or contract
            performance, you have the right to receive them in a structured,
            commonly used, and machine-readable format. You can also request us
            to transmit these data to another personal data controller.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Object:</strong> If we process personal data based
            on our legitimate interests, you have the right to object to such
            processing. In such cases, we will cease processing your personal
            data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate reasons for
            processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or
            for legal claims. If your personal data is processed for marketing
            purposes, upon receiving your objection, we will promptly cease such
            processing. Consequently, you will no longer receive offers of our
            products and services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> If processing is based
            on your consent, you have the right to withdraw it at any time.
            However, withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of
            processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

          <li>
            <strong>
              Right not to be Subject to Automated Decision-Making:
            </strong>{" "}
            Except in cases where processing is necessary for entering into or
            performing a contract, permitted by applicable law, or based on your
            explicit consent, you have the right not to be subject to decisions
            based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that
            significantly affect you or have legal effects on you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Supervisory Authority:
