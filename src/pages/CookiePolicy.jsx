            or not your personal data is being processed. Should we be

            <strong>
              Right to Erasure of Personal Data ("Right to Be Forgotten"):
            </strong>{" "}
            You reserve the right to request the erasure of personal data

            circumstances:

              </li>
              <li>
                If you withdraw your consent to their processing and no other
                legal grounds exist for their processing (relevant only if we
                process personal data based on your consent);
              </li>
              <li>

              requests for the erasure of personal data if their processing is
              essential for exercising the right to freedom of expression and
              information, for complying with any of our legal obligations, for
              performing a task carried out in the public interest, for
              establishing, exercising, or defending our legal claims, or for

        <p>
          <strong>Right to Restriction of Processing:</strong> As outlined in

          restriction of processing your personal data for a specific duration.

        <p>
          <strong>
            Right to Data Portability and Provision of Data in Machine-Readable
            Format:
          </strong>{" "}
          In instances of automated processing based on your consent or the
          performance of a contract, you are entitled to receive your data in a
          structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. Moreover, you
          have the right for us to transmit this data to another personal data
          controller.
        </p>

          <strong>Right to Object:</strong> If we process your personal data
          based on our legitimate interests, you hold the right to object to
          such processing. Upon filing such an objection, we will refrain from
          processing your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling
          legitimate grounds for the processing that supersede your interests,
          rights, and freedoms. This includes instances necessary for the
          establishment, exercise, or defence of our legal claims.

          you offers regarding our products and services.

        <p>
          <strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> Should processing be
          reliant on your consent, you hold the right to withdraw that consent
          at any given time. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the
          lawfulness of processing based on the consent provided prior to its
          withdrawal.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Right Not to be Subject to Automated Decision-Making:</strong>{" "}
          With the exception of cases where processing is indispensable for
          entering into or fulfilling a contract, where permitted by applicable
          law, or upon your explicit consent, you maintain the right not to be
          subjected to any decisions solely based on automated processing,
          including profiling, that have legal ramifications for you or
          significantly affect you.
